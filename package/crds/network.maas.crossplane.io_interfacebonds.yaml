The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation.
                      The operating mode of the bond. (Default: active-backup). Supported bonding modes: - “balance-rr“: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance. - “active-backup“: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch. - “balance-xor“: Transmit based on the selected transmit hash policy. The default policy is a simple [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address XOR packet type ID) modulo slave count]. - “broadcast“: Transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance. - “802.3ad“: IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Uses all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification. - “balance-tlb“: Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. - “balance-alb“: Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support.

The default policy is a simple [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address XOR packet type ID) modulo slave count]. - broadcast: Transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance. - 802.3ad: IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Uses all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification. - balance-tlb: Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. - balance-alb: Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation.
                      The operating mode of the bond. (Default: active-backup). Supported bonding modes: - “balance-rr“: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance. - “active-backup“: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch. - “balance-xor“: Transmit based on the selected transmit hash policy. The default policy is a simple [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address XOR packet type ID) modulo slave count]. - “broadcast“: Transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance. - “802.3ad“: IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings.
