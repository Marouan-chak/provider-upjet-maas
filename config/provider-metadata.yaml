If no parameters are given, a random machine will be allocated and deployed using the defaults. NOTE: The MAAS provider currently provides both standalone resources and in-line resources for network interfaces. You cannot use in-line network interfaces in conjunction with any standalone network interfaces resources. Doing so will cause conflicts and will overwrite network configs.'

Supported bonding modes: - balance-rr: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance. - active-backup: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond''s MAC address is externally visible on only one port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch. - balance-xor: Transmit based on the selected transmit hash policy. The default policy is a simple [(source MAC address XOR''d with destination MAC address XOR packet type ID) modulo slave count]. - broadcast: Transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance. - 802.3ad: IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Uses all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification. - balance-tlb: Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. - balance-alb: Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation.'
